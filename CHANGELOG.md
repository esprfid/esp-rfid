## [0.3beta] - 2017-12-09 (zeraien)
#### Added
- Automatically disconnects wifi until an "admin" card is read in by the user. Default is to keep wifi on unless configured otherwise.

## [0.3alpha2] - 2017-08-31

#### Added
- Support for jQuery v1.12.4
- Support for Bootstrap Javascript v3.3.7
- Support for Bootstrap Glyphicons

#### Changed
- Refactored picclist command (JSON Array is now more human readable, can be queried page by page, initially 15 records per page due to Mobile Devices limiting maximum WebSocket message lenght, I do not know if this a feature or a bug)
- Restoring User Data is improved (restoring is now done one by one only when the ESP is ready to digest another userfile)
