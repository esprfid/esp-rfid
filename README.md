# Announcement

We are rising funds for next version (2.0) of ESP-RFID.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://opencollective.com/esp-rfid/tiers/esp-rfid-user.svg?avatarHeight=56">
</p>

What to expect from version 2.0:

* Better Wi-Fi connection handling
* MQTT Subscribing (activate relay on MQTT event)
* Better handling of hardware state (like health checks)
* Time Based One Time Password access (keypad abstraction layer)
* More polished WebUI
* Yet still Open Source (MIT License)
* Optional Goal --> NFC NDEF transactions from mobile phone to esp-rfid and vice versa

### What You Will Need
### Hardware
* [Official ESP-RFID Relay Board](https://www.tindie.com/products/nardev/esp-rfid-relay-board-12v-in-esp8266-board/)
or
* An ESP8266 module or a development board like **WeMos D1 mini** or **NodeMcu 1.0** with at least **32Mbit Flash (equals to 4MBytes)** (ESP32 does not supported for now)
* A MFRC522 RFID PCD Module or PN532 NFC Reader Module or RDM6300 125KHz RFID Module Wiegand based RFID reader
* A Relay Module (or you can build your own circuit)
* n quantity of Mifare Classic 1KB (recommended due to available code base) PICCs (RFID Tags) equivalent to User Number

### Software

#### Using Compiled Binaries
Download compiled binaries from GitHub Releases page
https://github.com/esprfid/esp-rfid/releases
On Windows you can use **"flash.bat"**, it will ask you which COM port that ESP is connected and then flashes it. You can use any flashing tool and do the flashing manually. The flashing process itself has been described at numerous places on Internet.

#### Building With PlatformIO
##### Backend
The build environment is based on [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org). Follow the instructions found here: http://platformio.org/#!/get-started for installing it but skip the ```platform init``` step as this has already been done, modified and it is included in this repository. In summary:

```
sudo pip install -U pip setuptools
sudo pip install -U platformio
git clone https://github.com/esprfid/esp-rfid.git
cd esp-rfid
platformio run
```

When you run ```platformio run``` for the first time, it will download the toolchains and all necessary libraries automatically.

##### Useful commands:

* ```platformio run``` - process/build all targets
* ```platformio run -e generic -t upload``` - process/build and flash just the ESP12e target (the NodeMcu v2)
* ```platformio run -t clean``` - clean project (remove compiled files)

The resulting (built) image(s) can be found in the directory ```/bin``` created during the build process.

##### Frontend
You can not simply edit Web UI files because you will need to convert them to C arrays, which can be done automatically by a gulp script that can be found in tools directory or you can use compiled executables at the same directory as well (for Windows PCs only).

If you want to edit esp-rfid's Web UI you will need (unless using compiled executables):
* NodeJS
* npm (comes with NodeJS installer)
* Gulp (can be installed with npm)

Gulp script also minifies HTML and JS files and compresses (gzip) them.

To minify and compress the frontend, enter the folder ```tools/webfilesbuilder``` and:
* Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
* Run ```npm start``` to compress the web UI to make it ready for the ESP

In order to test your changes without flashing the firmware you can launch websocket emulator which is included in tools directory.
* You will need to Node JS for websocket emulator.
* Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
* Run emulator  ```node wserver.js```

There are two alternative ways to test the UI
1. you can launch your browser with CORS disabled:
  ```chrome.exe --args --disable-web-security -–allow-file-access-from-files --user-data-dir="C:\Users\USERNAME"```
  and then open the HTML files directly (Get more information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome))
2. alternatively, you can launch a web server from the ```src/websrc``` folder, for example with Python, like this:
  ```python3 -m http.server```
  and then visit ```http://0.0.0.0:8000/```

When testing locally, use the password ```neo``` for admin capabilities.


### Pin Layout

The following table shows the typical pin layout used for connecting readers hardware to ESP:

| ESP8266 | NodeMcu/WeMos | Wiegand | PN532 | MFRC522 | RDM6300 | 
|--------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| GPIO-15 | D8            |         | SS    | SDA/SS  |         |
| GPIO-13 | D7            | D0      | MOSI  | MOSI    |         |
| GPIO-12 | D6            | D1      | MISO  | MISO    |         |
| GPIO-14 | D5            |         | SCK   | SCK     |         |
| GPIO-04 | D2            |         |       |         |         |
| GPIO-05 | D1            |         |       |         |         |
| GPIO-03 | RX            |         |       |         | TX      |

For Wiegand based readers, you can configure D0 and D1 pins via settings page. By default, D0 is GPIO-4 and D1 is GPIO-5

### Steps
* First, flash firmware (you can use /bin/flash.bat on Windows) to your ESP either using Arduino IDE or with your favourite flash tool
* (optional) Fire up your serial monitor to get informed
* Search for Wireless Network "esp-rfid-xxxxxx" and connect to it (It should be an open network and does not require password)
* Open your browser and type either "http://192.168.4.1" or "http://esp-rfid.local" (.local needs Bonjour installed on your computer) on address bar.
* Log on to ESP, default password is "admin"
* Go to "Settings" page
* Configure your amazing access control device. Push "Scan" button to join your wireless network, configure RFID hardware, Relay Module.
* Save settings, when rebooted your ESP will try to join your wireless network.
* Check your new IP address from serial monitor and connect to your ESP again. (You can also connect to "http://esp-rfid.local")
* Go to "Users" page
* Scan a PICC (RFID Tag) then it should glimpse on your Browser's screen.
* Type "User Name" or "Label" for the PICC you scanned.
* Choose "Allow Access" if you want to
* Click "Add"
* Congratulations, everything went well, if you encounter any issue feel free to ask help on GitHub.

### MQTT
You can integrate ESP-RFID with other systems using MQTT. Read the [additional documentation](./README-MQTT.md) for all the details.

### Known Issues
* You need to connect your MFRC522 reader to your ESP properly or you will end up with a boot loop
* Please also check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/esprfid/esp-rfid/issues).

#### Time
We are syncing time from a NTP Server (in Client -aka infrastructure- Mode). This will require ESP to have an Internet connection. Additionally your ESP can also work without Internet connection too (Access Point -aka Ad-Hoc- Mode),  without giving up functionality.
This will require you to do syncing manually. ESP can store and hold time for you approximately 51 days without a major issue, device time can drift from actual time depending on usage, temperature, etc.
So you have to login to settings page and sync it in a timely fashion.

## **Security**
We assume **ESP-RFID** project -as a whole- does not offer strong security. There are PICCs available that their UID (Unique Identification Numbers) can be set manually (Currently esp-rfid relies only UID to identify its users). Also there may be a bug in the code that may result free access to your belongings. And also, like every other network connected device esp-rfid is vulnerable to many attacks including Man-in-the-middle, Brute-force, etc.

This is a simple, hobby grade project, do not use it where strong security is needed.

What can be done to increase security? (by you and by us)

* We are working on more secure ways to Authenticate RFID Tags.
* You can disable wireless network to reduce attack surface. (This can be configured in Web UI Settings page)
* Choose a strong password for the Web UI

## Scalability
Since we are limited on both flash and ram size things may get ugly at some point in the future. You can find out some test results below.

### Tests

#### 1) How many RFID Tag can be handled?
Restore some randomly generated user data on File System worth:

* 1000 separate "userfile"
* random 4 Bytes long UID and
* random User Names and
* 4 bytes random Unix Time Stamp
* each have "access type" 1 byte integer "1" or "0".

Total 122,880 Bytes

At least 1000 unique User (RFID Tag) can be handled, the test were performed on WeMos D1 mini.

#### Additional testing is needed:

* Logging needs testing. How long should it need to log access? What if a Boss needs whole year log?
* Reliability on Flash (these NOR Flash have limited write cycle on their cells). It depends on manufacturer choice of Flash Chip and usage.
