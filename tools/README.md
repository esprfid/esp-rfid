# Tools

Both tools can be found already built in the Github releases, if you don't want to install all the needed dependencies.

If you want to modify the tools instead you need to install all the Node dependencies and hack your way around.

On every push the binaries are generated by Github actions and if needed a new release should be published with the binaries.

## webfilesbuilder

The `webfilesbuilder` executable that you can get from the releases should be copied in the `tools/webfilesbuilder/` folder and run from there as it looks for files in specific folders relative to that location.
